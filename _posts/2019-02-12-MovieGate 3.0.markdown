## Introduction

MovieGate 3.0 is live!, this release contains some major changes:

- Movie library, now you can use this section to save your favorite movies, or keep track of the movies you have watched, you can also use it to make a watch list because of the ability to download the selected movie along with its subtitles directly from the library without the need to search for it again!

- The flow of the application has changed a little, from now on, all the qualities will be shown and you can decide which quality you want on the Download dialog.

- Some minor UI fixes and experience improvements.

If you found a bug contact me on one of the links on the left, or on the top if you're on your phone. :)

## Important Notice

I noticed that a number of antivirus software are showing a warning or marking the setup installer as a suspicious file, its because i am using a custom installer that checks for updates before installing to make sure you have the latest version, here are reports from Virus Total and OPSWAT Metadefender:
