MovieGate is a software that helps you browse and download movies, you can lookup movie information, watch trailers, with a nice and clean UI.

This project got finished in about two weeks, i had alot of fun in the process especially with the UI aspect.

In addition it was my first experience with licensing and software protection, it may be a small project but working with licensing made me feel like i was designing a software for a big corporation XD.
