## Introduction


MovieGate is a software that helps you browse and download movies, you can lookup movie information, watch trailers, with a nice and clean UI.

This project got finished in about two weeks, i had alot of fun in the process especially with the UI aspect.

In addition it was my first experience with licensing and software protection, it may be a small project but working with licensing made me feel like i was designing a software for a big corporation XD.

MovieGate has an auto update feature, it will notify the user whenever a new version is live.

If you found a bug or you wish to purchase a license contact me on one of the links on the left, or on the top if you're on your phone. :)
